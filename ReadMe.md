####_BIOGRAPHY_

My name is Leslyn but I prefer to be called Whitney. I was studying to become a nurse after taking care of
my dad for 5 years, but after I started working with my aunt doing IT work I found that I really enjoyed what 
I was doing. I changed my major adn this is my first round of CIS courses. 

I now live with my aunt while we also work together. I do love my cat who can be quite the pain in the butt!

Warm-up= How many computers are in V-129? I believe that there are 33 desktop computers, each student might 
have a personal computer in their backpack which would make 64, and each student has a smartphone would make 
it 96 total computers in this classroom!

Skill 1.1 - Installing Windows 10 Notes:
1. Take notes for yourself on...
	a. determine hardware requirements and compatability;
	b. choose between upgrade and a clean install;
	c. determine appropriate editions according to device types;
	e. determine and create 

Windows 10 Editions: Home, Pro, Enterprise, Mobile, Mobile Enterprise, Education, IOT Core, and S.
>determining appropiate editions according to device type
processor- 1 (GHz) 
ram- 1 GB for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
hard disk space- 16 GB 

Deployment options
	-wipe and load> viable for all scenarios
	-in place upgrade> recommended for existing 7/8/8.1 devices
	-or provisioning(adding a special file) BYOD> for Windows 10 CYOD scenarios

ADK IS A TOOL YOU CAN USE TO SEE IF THE HARDWARE IS UPGRADABLE-

wipe and load> start with 7/8/8.1>capture data& settings> remove existing OS> install new OS> install apps>
>restore all documents 

Skill 1.1 Technical BLog Prompt:
1. My boyfriend, Ryan Cameron, has a newer laptop that has not recieved an update since he had it.. it runs 
slow and even doing simple maintenance it still has a hard time with being slow. 
2. The technical specs needed for the upgrade are:
	•Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.
	•RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit)
	•Free hard disk space: 16 GB.
	•Graphics card: Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver.
	•A Microsoft account and Internet access
3. The way I would upgrade this sysem would be to completely wipe it due to the face that there really is 
not much that needs to be saved on the hard-drive. Also, this would be the best way because there are a lot 
of failed updates whcih could mean that the current OS is corrupted and needs to be reloaded anyway. I
prefer to wipe a computer to make sure that the OS was not the cause of any issue to begin with. 
4. The version of Windows 10  that I would install in this computer would be Windows 10 Home since he really 
isn't too tech savvy. Windows 10 Home would give him the basic OS that wouldn't be too much of a change from
his Windows 8.1 layout. 

WARM-UP= What is "Patch Tuesday"? When did it last occur? What was included in the most rececnt?
website: www.krebsonsecurity.com
Definition: Microsoft introducing security patches foe their OS. 
Last Occured: September 11, 2018
Included: fixing some vulnerablilites in internet explorer and edge.

Skill Level 1.2 Technical Blog Prompt:
1. Why would a user be interested in multiple partitions on a hard drive?  Use a Windows tool (GUI or CLI)
to create a partition and describe the steps that you took to create multiple partitions.
Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary 
storage, so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately. The steps I took are 
Steps
	A. Start menu
	B. Disk Management tool
	C. Clean-up some old files if needed to make space for partition
	D. Shrink the drive
	E. Create a new volume
	F. The New Simple Volume Wizard
	G. Give it a size
	H. Name it
	I. GO!
2. Describe each step that requires "user attention" during the clean installation of Windows 10.
	A. Language selection
	B. You can choose to go through with the preselected options or manually check things like sharing
machine informationwith Microsoft. 
	C. Personalize colors/name your PC
3. What is one Windows Feature that you chose to add after installation?  How did you add that feature?

Skill Level 1.3 Technical Blog Prompt:
1. Create a list of hardware that a user might have that require a driver installation.
	A. Printer 
	B. Stamp label maker
2. Locate a device from your list.
3. Locate the version of the driver and see if it is the most current version available 
4. Disable the device.  Does this affect Windows performance?  What happens when you disable other devices?  
Try disabling your network card - how was that experience?
When I disabled the device on my computer it really did not affect it, it jsut turned the device into a faded 
picture to show that it was disabled or offline. Turning off the network card took my whole computer off the 
network and messed with my connection to the office computer. I had to reconnect to the network that it was 
on which meant I had to connect to the 2.4 wireless, and then everything was fine.
5. Why would I disable updates over metered connections?  Capture a screenshot of the screen on which you 
disabled this feature.
That would be a great idea because some of the windows updates are massive and on a metered connection it can 
go over or seriously slow your bandwidth. 
6. Perform a "rollback" of a driver update.
7. After installing a USB microphone, a system has extremely poor performance.  How would you check to see if
the performance issues are related to the USB microphone?
	A. If the problem is with the microphone itself, check the settings in the application
	B. Make sure the drivers for that device are updated
	C. Try something simple- swap ports, plug it into another port
	D. Clean out any old drivers for other devices that can interfere with the microphone, I do this when 
installing new HP Printers because they are notorious for using the previous driver for a different product
and this can cause problems, so it would be best to start with a clean slate before installing the microphone 
software.

Warm-up= In the article about Windows releasing Ignite 2018 I feel that operating systems will be narrowed
down to MAC VS WINDOWS. It's like the argument FORD VS. CHEVY. This is a big push to help ease the migration 
process thatwill be happening when they stop supporting Windows 7 and transfer to Windows 10. This release 
will bring an ease for people making the jump from an older OS. While they are rolling this out they are 
making bluky hardware a thing of the past. 
 
Skill 1.4 Technical Blog Prompt
My skill was •Configure Hyper-V 
	     •Configure power settings
1. Start Hyper-V Manager by clicking Start, Administrative Tools, Hyper-V Manager.
2. In Hyper-V Manager, right-click the server node in the left pane, point to New, and then select Virtual
Machine.
Also, make sure you meet the requirements for running the Hyper-V:
	• Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education
	• 64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation 
	• CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension 
	• Minimum of 4 GB memory.
Configuring power settings is quite easy but one issue I have found with Windows 10 is when in power settings 
or options, you now have an option of choose what the power button does and sometimes those checks are 
unchecked and you will have to go in and change those so your computer will actually shut down instead of 
rebooting.

Skill 1.5 Technical Blog Prompt
Warm Up- What is a "software bug"? Describe the "bug" that is delaying the release of the 1809 update for 
Windows 10?
	A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to 
produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The "bug" that is holding up the
newest release of Windows 10 is consumers reported a number of problems with the latest major update to Windows
10 — including deletion of user files — Microsoft has pulled the update entirely to investigate.

Warm-up 
What is BitLocker? How is it configured? I have a USB drive that is configured with BitLocker. Will it work on 
all Windows 10 machines? How about a MacBook or a Chromebook?
BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses 
thethreats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.
What is BitLocker?
BitLocker lets you encrypt the hard drive(s) on your Windows 7 and Vista Enterprise, Windows 7 and Vista Ultimate 
or Windows Server 2008 and R2.  BitLocker will not encrypt hard drives for Windows XP, Windows 2000 or Windows 
2003.  
Only Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008 include BitLocker.  BitLocker drives can be encrypted with 128 bit or 256 
bit encryption, this is plenty strong to protect your data in the event the computer is lost or stolen.
If your computer meets the Windows version and TPM requirements, the process for enabling BitLocker is as 
follows:
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), 
and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.
Click Turn on BitLocker.
The answer is YES, but M3 Bitlocker Loader for Mac is required. Although Microsoft just developed and released 
Windows-only Bitlocker, has not implemented Bitlocker for Mac version, but with help of M3 Bitlocker Loader for 
Mac, 
Bitlocker is compatibile with Mac.Aug 2, 2017.
Bitlocker is a proprietary Microsoft Windows product and is not supported on ChromeOS. You will have to remove 
the encryption using a Windows computer before it can be accessed anywhere else.

The best approach for exchanging documents between platforms is to use cloud storage (Drive, Dropbox, Onedrive)
which provides security and easy access

Technical Blog Skill 2.1 
Create a "Top 5" list of Windows 10 networking best practices, tips, tricks and troubleshooting strategies.
Your list should include:
Step 1: Understand and prepare for the challenges of migration.  As a first step to preparing for a Windows 10 
migration,
you should examine the challenges that come with the upgrade. The first involves preparing for the new 
Windows-as-a-Service model for future releases and update cycles. Once Windows 10 is installed, the cumulative 
nature of its patches means trying to distribute massive update files to thousands, if not tens of thousands, 
of PCs enterprise-wide. This can lead to significant network bottlenecks that can severely impact business 
operations for on-premise updates.  You need to explore technologies and solutions that can speed Windows 10 
content distribution, while protecting network bandwidth. You also need to develop processes for preparing for 
increased IT workloads and slow operations due to more frequent releases.  

Step 2: Rationalize applications. Reducing the number of software titles to the ones your company needs will 
shrink migration costs and cut time frames. With the help of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 
(SCCM), enterprises can collect raw inventory data, normalize and categorize applications, then identify which 
apps should be consolidated, retired, upgraded and migrated. Keep in mind that application rationalization 
should happen continually both before and after deployment so your organization will always be ready and can 
move quickly for future updates.

Step 3: Prepare your infrastructure. You should closely examine the issue of compatibility. An OS migration is 
a huge undertaking, and you need to know if the new software will be compatible with existing infrastructure. 
Legacy infrastructure can cause critical compatibility issues due to its age and resulting complexity. Moving 
legacy applications can also be troublesome for many businesses. 
While Microsoft has promised high compatibility with Windows 7, you must still plan and budget for the 
substantial effort involved in maintaining application compatibility, and the potential for costly remediation 
or application upgrades that may be required. In short, IT must perform rigorous, time consuming tests to ensure 
that the new OS won’t break any legacy systems.

Step 4: Select the right migration option. Once preparations are in place, you should determine which migration 
options to pursue. 
For some devices a wipe and load option, where you capture data and settings, deploy (custom) OS Image, install 
drivers and applications, and then restore the data and settings, might work best. For devices that are already 
running Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, an in-place upgrade that lets Windows do the work would be a simpler approach. New 
devices must be configured and provisioned to be enterprise ready.

Step 5: Explore ways to speed migrations. When it comes time to deploy Windows 10, the size of the deployment 
package will have a significant impact on your network bandwidth. The most efficient way to manage bandwidth usage 
and improve time to deployment is to employ a onetime download strategy, where updates are distributed to a local 
cache and then shared peer-to-peer rather than having each system 
download the files. 
For cumulative Windows 10 updates down the road, companies should consider taking advantage of a differential 
technology that only sends the change files in each new release a single time to each operating location to help 
minimize traffic and improve network speed.

Technical Blog Skill 2.2 
In your Technical Blog, address the following two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Creating a Large Volume

You have a new desktop running Windows 10. However, you try to copy your file repository and find out that you do 
not have enough disk space.
You have 400 GB of free disk space on your C drive and you have 3 smaller 500 GB drives. What can you do?
You can pool all of your storage and make it to where you can transfer your files to the current desktop.

Scenario 2: Configuring a Storage Space/Storage Pool

           You create a new storage pool for the following disks on your Windows 10 computer:

Serial ATA (SATA): 1 TB
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS): 1 TB
           SATA and SAS are two different types of drives with different connectors/interfaces.

           What is the maximum size you can allocate for your new storage space? 2 TB 
With a 1 TB SATA serial drive one can create a storage capacity up to 2 TB. With a 1 TB serial attached SCSI a user 
can also create a 2 TB pool combined together to produce 4 TB. This can be done because Storages Spaces can group two 
or more drives together to create a storage pool

Notes- NTFS: better than FAT but FAT 32 is a viable component.

Lab 10: Share a Virtual Printer

Lab 12: Configure Local User File Sharing

Warm-up 
Browse the Windows Store. What app did you find that suprised you? Is there an essential app to your life missing 
that from the store. 
What is it and where can one find it?
I didn't find an app that suprised me, there is a $4.99 for a paint, there is an Amazon store but not Ebay, they 
are all pretty much in daily life for people so it would not be a smart idea for the store to not include these apps. 
I tried going through in my mind the apps I use on the daily and I found them all, even my streaming services like 
hulu and spotify. They did not have my amazon prime video though which is an app that can be downloaded like netlix 
or hulu. You can go into your smartphone or tablet and go into the store and download.
Why does Microsoft have the store?
I believe they do because they want to be in the game against the Apple Machine with their Apple Store. They also 
included the gamingconsole X-Box to not only compete with Apple but other gaming websites.
